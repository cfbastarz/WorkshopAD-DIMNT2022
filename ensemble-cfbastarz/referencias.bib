abstract = {Abstract This article presents the Centre for Weather Forecast and Climate Studies (CPTEC) developments for configuring a global sub-seasonal prediction system and assessing its ability in producing retrospective predictions (hindcasts) for meteorological conditions of the following 4 weeks. Six Brazilian Global Atmospheric Model version 1.2 (BAM-1.2) configurations were tested in terms of vertical resolution, deep convection and boundary-layer parametrizations, as well as soil moisture initialization. The aim was to identify the configuration with best performance when predicting weekly accumulated precipitation, weekly mean 2 m temperature (T2M) and the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) daily evolution. Hindcasts assessment was performed for 12 extended austral summers (November–March, 1999/2000– 2010/2011) with two start dates for each month for the six configurations and two ensemble approaches. The first approach, referred to as Multiple Configurations Ensemble (MCEN), was formed of one ensemble member from each of the six configurations. The second, referred to as Initial Condition Ensemble (ICEN), was composed of six ensemble members produced with the chosen configuration as the best using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) perturbation methodology. The chosen configuration presented high correlation and low root-mean-squared error (RMSE) for precipitation and T2M anomaly predictions at the first week and these indices degraded as lead time increased, maintaining moderate performance up to week-4 over the tropical Pacific and northern South America. For MJO predictions, this configuration crossed the 0.5 bivariate correlation threshold in 18 days. The ensemble approaches improved the correlation and RMSE of precipitation and T2M anomalies. ICEN improved precipitation and T2M predictions performance over eastern South America at week-3 and over northern South America at week-4. Improvements were also noticed for MJO predictions. The time to cross the above-mentioned threshold increased to 21 days for MCEN and to 20 days for ICEN.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an inter-comparison performance assessment of the newly developed Centre for Weather Forecast and Climate Studies (CPTEC) model (the Brazilian Atmospheric Model version 1.2, BAM-1.2) against four sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction project models from: Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Environmental and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). The inter-comparison was performed using hindcasts of weekly precipitation anomalies and the daily evolution of Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) for 12 extended austral summers (November–March, 1999/2000–2010/2011), leading to a verification sample of 120 hindcasts. The deterministic assessment of the prediction of precipitation anomalies revealed ECMWF as the model presenting the highest (smallest) correlation (root mean squared error, RMSE) values among all examined models. JMA ranked as the second best performing model, followed by ECCC, CPTEC and BoM. The probabilistic assessment for the event “positive precipitation anomaly” revealed that ECMWF presented better discrimination, reliability and resolution when compared to CPTEC and BoM. However, these three models produced overconfident probabilistic predictions. For MJO predictions, CPTEC crosses the 0.5 bivariate correlation threshold at around 19 days when using the mean of 4 ensemble members, presenting similar performance to BoM, JMA and ECCC. Overall, CPTEC proved to be competitive compared to the S2S models investigated, but with respect to ECMWF there is scope to improve the prediction system, likely by a combination of including coupling to an interactive ocean, improving resolution and model parameterization schemes, and better methods for ensemble generation.},
